4. Start the web application:
   - Make sure Apache and PHP are set up to serve the application.
   - Alternatively, use Docker to containerize the app.

## Usage

- **Accessing the Web Interface**: Open [http://localhost/index.php](http://localhost/index.php) in your browser.
- **Backup Operations**: Use `backup_scheduler.php` for scheduling backups or `manual_backup.php` for manual backups.
- **User Management**: Admin users can manage system users via `users.php`.
- **Backup Restoration**: Restore backups via `restore_backup.php`.

## Docker Setup (Optional)
If you prefer to containerize the application:
1. Refer to the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for setup instructions.
2. Build and run the Docker containers:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
